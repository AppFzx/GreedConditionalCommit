# GreedConditionalCommit
Prototype implementation demoing test &amp;&amp; commit || revert

"""
I want to try something a little different. I was reading a blog post from Michael Feathers that referenced this article from Kent Beck: https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864

Make a stab at the Greed kata in python using the "test && commit || revert" approach.
I'll do the same and we'll compare notes.
Greed kata: http://codingdojo.org/kata/Greed/

I'm not overly interested in your python code. I assume you know how to use Google and Stack Overflow to make stuff work.
We'll use our respective experiences as a jumping off point for a discussion on software development in general.
